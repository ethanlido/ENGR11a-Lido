            <h1>Project 2</h1>
            <!-- Writeup -->
            <p>For my first remix project in TinkerCAD, I had an idea to make a two-faced design with one design if you look from one perspective, and another design from another perspective. I found a cartoon Super Mario jumping keychain that I remixed with a warp pipe design I found.</p>
            <p>My first step was to patch the holes on one side of Mario. Essentially, I had to make one side flat to have a clean canvas for my remix. My first idea was to make an outline of the shape, essentially like a cookie cutter, to then merge with Mario to make the correct shape. However, this didn’t pan out exactly how I wanted to. I asked Gianna and Prof. Rogers for help, and they didn’t exactly see the vision of this idea. However, Prof. Rogers made another suggestion to duplicate the Mario, and fill in all the holes, then merge everything together. I tried with a lot of cylinders, but this wasn’t very effective. I basically “brute forced” with the scribble tool to fill in the holes, and then merged with the original, and it turned out very well.</p>
            <p> Now that the hardest part was over, I added some more shapes (thanks to TinkerCAD’s easier UI) and I added a cylinder in the middle to support the mario from one side, as well as for my flagpole from the other side. In reality, the print failed. The first time was likely because the very very small amount of surface area that is actually adhering to the board is not strong enough to support the rest of the cylinder. The second time around, I tried printing the design straight up. Even though it survived most of the way, it failed after about 80%, likely from bad support.
            In both cases, the pipe was the only thing to survive. In reflection, I really want to make this design into a reality. It looks really cool, but I need to add more supports.</p>
            <p>For my second remix in Fusion, I had trouble finding another idea. Frankly, Fusion was extremely difficult and frustrating, so I tried to find something easier, but still cool. However, after finally completing the first tutorial, I found myself with a tumbler cup, which I decided to imprint a Smash ball on the front.</p>
            
            <p>I first found an STL file of a smash ball and imported it into Fusion (which in itself was obnoxiously difficult). I had trouble with the sizing and saving of the file. I didn’t know how to scale it after I imported it– definitely less intuitive compared to TinkerCAD. It also took a bit to get used to the version history saving format, but I figured it out after a few saves.
            Next, I tilted the smash ball and moved it onto the side of the tumbler. There was no merge button, as in TinkerCAD, but honestly it was good enough for me.</p>


            <p>Now that I have the completed print, I’m very happy with how it turned out! The Fusion tutorial (expectedly) turned out very solid. The smash ball had a bit of overhang on both sides, which I must’ve missed in the Fusion design. But, I’m sure as the semester goes on, I’ll learn more about how to use Fusion and fix issues like this in the future.</p>
