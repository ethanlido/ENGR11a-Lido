            <h2>Documentation Review</h2>
            <p>I reviewed “Phoenix_v2_assembly_guide.pdf” and this video, both from the e-Nable hub. I find I learn best from visual/tactile instructions, i.e. watching someone build it, and following their exact steps.</p>
            <p>Overall, I found both the video and the pdf instructions easy to follow. I’m not sure what I would change. I found both of them helpful and complementary.</p>

            <p>At 150% scale, it was difficult to put everything on the print bed, so I ended up using 5 beds. I had to add a raft for the pins and other small pieces that I didn’t want damaged. Rafts are similar to supports where it’s not part of the design, but it’s an additional print setting to ensure success of your final print. Rafts connect everything on the bed together, essentially one big piece, so that little pieces don’t melt into each other or break the printer. For the beds with the pins and other small pieces, the raft was a success!</p>
            <p>With that said, I must’ve forgotten to change the raft settings when printing the palm piece. Since this was the only piece on the bed, I didn’t need the raft. I also experimented with some other pieces without rafts, like the gripper box and palm mesh. I forgot to take a comparison picture with the palm piece, but you can see the stringy bits on the holes of the hand in my final hand. This made stringing the hand more difficult, but I still got it.
            In general, I learned that there’s a balance between efficiency (using as few beds as possible) versus print quality (as few stringy bits as possible).</p>

            <p>While building the hand, I found myself often watching the video first, and referring back to the pdf instructions to check my work and make sure it all made sense</p>
