            <p>#1: Freshman living on campus with experiences using the dispensers mainly in emergency situations. Does not find they can entirely depend on the dispensers due to restocking issues.</p>

            <p>#2: Senior involved in a menstrual product accessibility project on campus. This is their “baby” and has put a lot of effort in coordinating students with the restock process and communicating with campus partners to expand and maintain the project.</p>

            <p>#3: Senior living on campus with previous experiences using menstrual product dispensers on campus and varying access across dorms.</p>

            <p>#4: Senior involved in community living on campus and the restocking process for freshmen dorms on campus.</p>


            <h2>Part 2: Problem Definition & Brainstorming</h2>

            <p> Our interviews went well. All my groupmates did their part for the interview process and we had some good thoughts for the next stage in the process. Our next step was to hone our problem statement and create a thematic analysis.</p>
            <p> For our thematic analysis, we split into installation, restocking, and characteristics of the dispenser.</p>

            <p>Next, we created insight statements for our three categories to summarize our 3-7 post-its into a single goal or idea. This was probably the most difficult part of the process thus far. We all had ideas, hence the many post-its, but it’s hard to condense into one insight statement, without discarding everyone’s input. After some brainstorming we were all satisfied with our final insight statements.</p>

            <p>Next, we created “How Might We” statements, which guide our imagined thoughts and ideas into something tangible. This reminded me of our first lecture where it’s important to set the constraints, so we have something to push against. The HMW step helped us funnel our insight statements into something we can actually design.</p>

            <p>The brainstorming and ideation process was when we combined our insight statements, HMW statements, and any random thoughts about our design onto paper (well, post-its). This, evidently, was a bit of a chaotic process. I appreciate William’s wild ideas, and Eric and Erica shared similar ideas as I did. We grouped these together and summarized them under our HMW statements.</p>

            <p>Finally, we created a storyboard to give a visual representation of how a user would use our product to solve their problem. In our case, we divided 12 frames into installer, restocker, and user. I think this was the most helpful step because we had something tangible and visual to measure if we’ve achieved our goal. Essentially, we’ve made our goal SMART. Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. I’m eager to take the next steps in our project!</p>
